  path = " ",
  GenePositionFile = " ",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_list}{List of raw expression matrix. Genes should be in
rows and cells should be in columns in each data in the list.}

\item{data_id}{List of names/ids of expression matrix}

\item{min_Sample}{gene filter, filter out genes which are not expressed
in at least min_Sample cells}

\item{min_Gene}{cell filter, filter out those cells which do not
express at least min_Gene genes}

\item{path}{Path of output directory to save results}

\item{GenePositionFile}{A gene/chromosome positions file with chromosome
name, start, end position. "genecode hg19" positional file is given with
this package. Either you can use same using unCTC::gencode_v19_gene_pos
or can download from other sources.}

\item{threads_no}{(int) number of threads for parallel steps (default: 8)}

\item{MetaData}{Optional, List of metadata of expression matricies in same
order in which expression matricies in data_list, Column number and names
of all the MetaData in the list must be same}

\item{Groupby}{Any column name from MetaData,which we want to use as
annotation file. Only applicable if MetaData is included.}

\item{cutoff}{The minimum average read counts per gene among
reference cells. (The default value is 1)}

\item{Reference_name}{Any one type of cell from data_id list or
any one cell type from column assign to Groupby.}

\item{obs.title}{Title of test/observation matrix.
Default is "Observations"}

\item{ref.title}{Title of reference matrix. Default is "References".}

\item{out.Filename}{Store results with out.Filename prefix.
Default is "inferCNV".}

\item{cluster_by_groups}{If observations are defined based on
groups (for example, patients), each group of cells will be
clustered independently. (default = FALSE; setting k obs groups
will be used)}

\description{
Use single cell RNA-Seq expression data to identify copy
number variation at chromosomal level such as deletions or gains of
entire chromosome or large segments of chromosome
