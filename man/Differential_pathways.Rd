\arguments{
\item{Pathway_score}{Output of PathwayEnrichmentScore.R method}

\item{DDLK_Clusters}{Output of DDLK_Clust.R method}

\item{DifferentiateBy}{Any column name from
DDLK_Clusters$PathwayDDLK_clust, default is "Clusters"}

\item{p_val}{Threshold p value, default is 0.05}

\item{lfc}{Threshold log fold change value, default is 0}

\item{up_pathways_number}{select number of upregulated pathways
in each group}
}
\value{
Diff_Pathways list of three objects
1. DiffMatpathway = Pathway matrix with top most
up_pathways_number differential pathways in each group
2. Diffup_pathways = top most up_pathways_number differential
 pathways in each group
3. annotations = Cell wise annotation of DifferentialMatrix
}
