Description: Unbiased identification and characterization of single CTC
    transcriptomes are aided by the unCTC process, which includes multiple
    techniques. Clustering of scRNA-seq profiles is a crucial part of this 
    process. We describe a robust method for grouping single-cell 
    transcriptomes in a meta-space that spans pathways and computes 
    enrichment scores based on gene expression readouts. The log-transformed 
    TPM (Transcripts Per Million) matrix/count associated with CTC 
    transcriptomes is transformed into a matrix comprising pathway 
    enrichment scores obtained using an R package,  GSVA, for unsupervised 
    clustering. Deep dictionary learning with k-means clustering 
    cost (DDLK)  is applied to these pathway scores. The K-means clustering
    cost is included in the deep dictionary learning (DDL) architecture 
    by DDLK. With the use of Stouffer's Z-score, unCTC allows for the 
    determination of a variety of canonical markers identifying 
    malignant/epithelial/immune origins (Stouffer et al., 1949). 
    In our opinion, gene-set-based techniques are effective in enhancing 
    single-marker-based and inferred-CNV-based cell-group characterization.
